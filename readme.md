# Portfolio

**This repo is a work in progess**

This is a collection of writeups that I wish to display. Each folder in `chals`
corresponds to a single challenge. Writeups are seperated by vulnerability 
class. Each writeup has tags associated with it such as architecture, where the
challenge originated, and other terms I think are important. **this is not a
complete list of my work**. A lot of the challenges I have completed are active 
on `hackthebox` (I am not allowed to publish those writeups until the 
challenges are archived). For a complete portfolio please send me a message.
